Artificer-s-Design
==================
This is an open source mod that we are working on. It's surrently a mishmash of stuff, but eventually will be something that resembles Leonardo De Vinci's inventions with elements of steam-punk and DnD. There is currently no public release of the mod, but a compiled version of the mod is in this Repo if you so wish to beta test it! If you have any ideas that aren;t currently in this mod I'm happy to take them, just message me or email me with those ideas and they will be added ASAP!! http://tinyurl.com/n99vrsl this is a link to our current idea list if you so choose to see what we have yet to add, and what we are currently working on. the mod is written with Minecraft forge build *.953 (Minecraft version 1.6.4) it will be updated to Minecraft 1.7.2 when there is a stable build of MCP, FML, and Minecraft Forge available to the public!
