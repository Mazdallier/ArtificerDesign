Artificer's Design
==================
This is an open source mod that we are working on. It's currently a mishmash of stuff, but eventually will be something that resembles steam-punk ~/~ DnD. There is currently no public release of the mod. If you have any ideas that are not currently in this mod I'm happy to take them! Just message me or email me with those ideas and they will be added ASAP!!	

The mod is written with Minecraft forge build *.1046 (Minecraft version 1.7.2). Just install minecraft forge *.1046 and run `gradlew.bat setupDevWorkspace` to setup gradle for this project, and `gradlew.bat eclipse` if you are going to use eclipse. Now all you need to do is make a workspace somewhere else, and import this mod to work on it.
