This is an open souce mod me and some friends are working on, its sorta based on the game DnD but very losely, there is currently no public release of the mod, but a compiled version of the mod is in this Repo if so you wish to beta test it! If you have any ideas that arn't currently in this mod im happy to take any new ideas, just message me or email me with those ideas and they will be added asap!! http://tinyurl.com/n99vrsl this is a link to our current idea list if you so choose to see what we have yet to add, and what we are currently working on. the mod is writtin with minecraft forge build *.953 (minecraft version 1.6.4) it will be updated to minecraft 1.7.2 when there is a stable build of MCP, FML, and Minecraft Forge available to the public!
