Artificer's Design
==================
This is an open source mod that we are working on. It's currently a mishmash of stuff, but eventually will be something that resembles steam-punk ~/~ DnD. There is currently no public release of the mod. If you have any ideas that are not currently in this mod I'm happy to take them! Just message me or email me with those ideas and they will be added ASAP!! http://tinyurl.com/n99vrsl here is a link to our current idea list if you so choose to see what we have yet to add, and what we are currently working on! The mod is written with Minecraft forge build *.1032+ (Minecraft version 1.7.2)
