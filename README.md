Artificer's Design
==================
This is an open source mod that we are working on. It has its own research system and 4 classes: Human Dwarf, Orc, and elf. Each class has its own research uniques items/mechines for example, dwarves are the only class to have a drill. The mod is still is super early beta and being worked on at a steady pace! :) if you have ANY ideas to add to any class just send me an email 'genis231@live.com'.	

The mod is written with Minecraft forge build *.1048 (Minecraft 1.7.2). Just run `gradlew.bat setupDevWorkspace` to setup gradle for this project, and `gradlew.bat eclipse` if you are going to use eclipse. Now all you need to do is make a workspace somewhere else, and import this mod to work on it.
